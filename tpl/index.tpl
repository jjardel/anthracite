<div class="hero-unit">
<h3>NagBot event manager</h3>
<p>
Track and manage changes and events that can have a business and/or operational impact.
</p>
</div>
While it's often not feasible to track/correctly attribute <i>all</i> changes,
<br/>it's good to have a tool to
<ul>
<li>manage the most important ones (maintenance, code changes, product launches, etc)</li>
<li>create/annotate events after the fact as anomalities are detected</li>
</ul>
